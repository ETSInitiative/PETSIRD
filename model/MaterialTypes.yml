  fields:
    atom: Atom

  fields:
    # unique id that can be used to refer to the material in voxelised maps etc
    id: uint
    # informative string, not standardised.
    # Expected examples: BGO, LSO, LYSO, LaBr, GAGG, plastic
    name: string
    # density of the material
    # Units: g/cc
    # TODO agree with vendors if this information can be supplied and to what accuracy
    density: float
    # List of atoms and their respective mass fractions
    # sum of massFractions should be 1
    # TODO agree with vendors if this information can be supplied and to what accuracy
    # Ideally this list should be reasonably accurate to be useful for Monte Carlo simulations, but can be approximate.
