# Type definition for how to encode how the scanner handles multiple coincidences when recording the prompts.
# Due to various effects (such as high count rate, prompt gammas), it is possible that multiple single
# events are detected within the coincidence window. This type encodes some different ways
# that this multiple events are handled, and recorded in the coincidence stream.
CoincidencePolicy: !enum
  values:
    # multiples will be rejected
    - rejectMultiples

    # multiples will be stored as a sequence of pairs, e.g. a triple leads to 3 pairs
    - storeMultiplesAsPairs

    # other options, to be listed in the future
