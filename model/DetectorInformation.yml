# This is the type for detector IDs using in `CoincidenceEvent` and `TripleEvent`.
# It is an unsigned integer that runs over all the "elementary detector elements" (aka crystals),
# starting from 0.
# The correspondence between this integer and a module/det_el is not decided (TODO),
# but the current proposal is to effectively increment the detectorID in nested loops:
# 1. ScannerGeometry.replicated_modules
# 2. replicated_module.transforms
# 3. replicated_module.detecting_elements
# 4. detecting_element.transforms
# (with therefore the detector IDs running faster over the 4th loop)
