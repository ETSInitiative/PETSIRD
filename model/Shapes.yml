# A box-shape specified by 8 corners (e.g. cuboid, wedge, etc.)
# TODO need to think about a clear definition of planes
# We do not want to have to check about intersection planes
# Potential mechanisms:
# - lexicographical ordering of corner coordinates?
# - first 4 coordinates give first plane, 5th and 6th need to define plane with first 2, etc.
