  fields:
    # identifiers of the two detecting elements (see doc for DetectionBin)
    # Note that it is possible that 2 "elementary detecting elements" are equal (e.g. for
    # inter-crystal Compton events)
    detectionBins: DetectionBin*3
    # timing differences (converted to mm) w.r.t. first event, stored as
    # indices into the tofBinEdges field in the ScannerInformation
    # Note: only 2, corresponding to the arrival time differences of the second and third detectionBins
    # listed w.r.t. the first detectionBin
