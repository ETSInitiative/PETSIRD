# All information about a triple event specified as identifiers (i.e. discretized).
TripleEvent: !record
  fields:

    # Note that it is possible that 2 detectorIDs are equal (e.g. for
    # inter-crystal Compton events)
    detectorIds: DetectorId*3
    # timing differences (converted to mm) w.r.t. first event, stored as
    # indices into the tofBinEdges field in the ScannerInformation
    # Note: only 2, corresponding to the arrival time differences of the second and third detectorId
    # listed w.r.t. the first detectorId
    tofIndices: uint*2
    # indices for each single event into the energyBinEdges field in the ScannerInformation
