# time-block that stores the detected (gamma photon) events as lists.
# An event time block optionally stores
# - singles
# - "prompt" coincidences (i.e. 2 photons detected within the coincidence window),
# - "delayed"coincidences (i.e. 2 photons with arrival time within the coincidence window after subtracting a
# (scanner dependent) offset for the second event)
# - triples
# - quadruples
# Note: PETSIRD currently does not allow storing higher order coincidences. These are very unlikely to occur in practice.
# It is expected that most scanners will only store prompt and delayed coincidences. If singles are stored, it is expected
# that coincidences are not stored, but this is not guaranteed.
#
# See also  the "policy" fields in ScannerInformation.
# For instance, if coincidences, triples and quadruples are stored, it is likely that ScannerInformation.promptEventPolicy = rejectHigherMultiples,
# ScannerInformation.tripleEventPolicy = rejectHigherMultiples, and ScannerInformation.quadrupleEventPolicy = rejectHigherMultiples as well,
# but this is not guaranteed.

   # than 2^32 picoseconds due to how time is stored, see SingleEvent.
