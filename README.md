# Toy PET data model

The purpose of this repo is to have a simple working example of a data model for PET imaging (list mode data). This is not a working example of how one would actually represent PET data; it is an illustration of how one would use the [yardl](https://github.com/Microsoft/yardl) tool to start defining such a model.

To get started quickly:
1. Open this repo in [GitHub Codespaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/codespaces) or in a [VS Code devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
2. `cd model && yardl generate`
3. Run cmake configure and build.
